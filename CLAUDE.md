# Project SPEC

Project: caswhois
Role: Efficient loader for AI.md

⚠️ **THIS FILE IS AUTO-LOADED EVERY CONVERSATION. FOLLOW IT EXACTLY.** ⚠️

Purpose:
- This file is a short loader for the most important rules
- `AI.md` is the full source of truth
- For complete details, read the referenced PARTs in `AI.md`

## Asking Questions

- **Default to continuing work** - do not stop just to ask whether you should continue
- **Never guess** - if the answer cannot be determined from `AI.md`, `IDEA.md`, the codebase, or repo state, ASK the user
- **Do NOT ask for permission to keep going** - continue until the current task is complete or blocked
- **Question mark = question** - when user ends with `?`, answer/clarify, don't execute

## Before ANY Code Change

1. Have I read the relevant PART in AI.md? (If no → read it)
2. Does this follow the spec EXACTLY? (If unsure → check spec)
3. Am I guessing or do I KNOW from the spec? (If guessing → read spec)
4. Would this pass the compliance checklist? (AI.md FINAL section)

**WHEN IN DOUBT: READ THE SPEC. DO NOT GUESS.**

## Binary Terminology
- **server** = `caswhois` (main binary, runs as service)
- **client** = `caswhois-cli` (REQUIRED companion, CLI/TUI/GUI)

## NEVER Do (Top 19) - VIOLATIONS ARE BUGS
1. Use bcrypt for config/backup passwords → Use Argon2id
2. Put Dockerfile in root → `docker/Dockerfile`
3. Use CGO → CGO_ENABLED=0 always
4. Hardcode dev values → Detect at runtime
5. Use external cron → Internal scheduler (PART 18)
6. Store config/backup passwords plaintext → Argon2id (API tokens use SHA-256)
7. Create premium tiers → All features free, no paywalls
8. Use Makefile in CI/CD → Explicit commands only
9. Guess or assume values that a command can produce → Run the command
10. Skip platforms → Build all 8 (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64)
11. Client-side rendering (React/Vue) → Server-side Go templates
12. Require JavaScript for core features → Progressive enhancement only
13. Let long strings break mobile → Use word-break CSS
14. Skip validation → Server validates EVERYTHING
15. Implement without reading spec → Read relevant PART first
16. Modify TEMPLATE.md or AI.md content → READ-ONLY SPEC
17. Edit `## Project variables` in IDEA.md without confirming with the user
18. Read an image larger than 1000×1000 directly into context
19. Use a non-conforming IDEA.md without migration

## ALWAYS Do - NON-NEGOTIABLE
1. Read AI.md before implementing ANY feature
2. Server-side processing (server does the work, client displays)
3. Mobile-first responsive CSS
4. All features work without JavaScript
5. Tor hidden service support (auto-enabled if Tor found)
6. Built-in scheduler, GeoIP, metrics, email, backup, update
7. All settings configurable via API and config file
8. Client binary for ALL projects
9. Commit often via `gitcommit` — small, focused commits
